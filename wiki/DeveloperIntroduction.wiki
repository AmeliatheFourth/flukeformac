= Introduction =
The current version of Fluke is built on python and needs the following libraries to build:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/ mutagen]
  * [http://appscript.sourceforge.net/py-appscript/index.html appscript]

= Building =
  # If you haven't installed Fluke at all, copy Xiph.component and FLACImporter.component from the _installer_ folder to /Library/QuickTime
  # Get ahold of mutagen and appscript through easy_install or by grabbing the source from the links above.
  # Make sure you've got the latest py2app:
{{{
sudo easy_install -U py2app
}}}
  # Build!
{{{
python setup.py py2app
}}}
  # Use the optional *-A* flag at the end if you're just screwing around and not building for distribution.

= What it does =
The general program flow is like this:
  # Clean up and process the input
  # Add tracks via appscript
  # Look up the missing metadata via mutagen (at the moment that would be the track number which iTunes doesn't pick up through Xiph.org) and assign it via appscript
  # Convert the tracks if the user specified it.
