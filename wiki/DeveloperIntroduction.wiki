= Introduction =
The current version of Fluke is built on python and needs the following libraries to build:
  * [http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/ mutagen]
  * [http://appscript.sourceforge.net/py-appscript/index.html appscript]

= Details =
The general program flow is like this:
  # Clean up and process the input
  # Add tracks via appscript
  # Look up the missing metadata via mutagen (at the moment that would be the track number which iTunes doesn't pick up through Xiph.org) and assign it via appscript
